This is a small game designed to draw attention to the dangers of SQL injections. Even though this type of attack should no longer work on most sites, there will almost certainly still be some where it poses a threat.

This game was created as part of the course "Denkweisen der Informatik" held at [Technische Universität Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/).

In SQL Quest you play a hacker who tries to obtain information from websites via SQL injections. You are always given a short introduction to a situation at the beginning. You will then be shown a website where you can demonstrate your skills. To help you, you will see a browser console on the right-hand side of a task, in which useful information is displayed.

In the game, you can reach your goal in a variety of ways (PS: The solutions are not static, so be creative 💫). You have the following SQL commands at your disposal: *SELECT, INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM*

*Note: All these commands are only simple implementations and will not understand advanced syntax. So keep your queries simple (you really won't need more)*
